# Adam Rakhmadi - Data-Analysis-Portfolio
## About 
Hi, I'm Adam! I have an analytical background in Conservation Energy and currently, I am on track to completing my study in Data Science. I have developed a strong foundation in the life sciences and a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data analysis and data science as an entry-level data specialist.

During my studies, I honed my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. I also gained experience in audit energy, data management, and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data specialist.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.
# Portofolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Customer Churn Analysis for European Bank Customers

ðŸ“„ [View My PDF Report](https://github.com/Adamrakhmadi/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/79c0f34a9bc471260f8999265048e7c9c9c83558/DATA_ANALYST.pdf)

**Goal:** To determine what factors to people will stay in the bank longer.

**Description:** The project focused on analyzing a dataset of European Bank Customers. The dataset including demographic, financial, and behavioral attributes. Each row represents a unique customer, with a binary churn indicator (1 = churned, 0 = retained), and other relevant information. The project involved loading the data, cleaning and preprocessing it, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), analyzing tables and chart by using tableau, and implemented insight for analysis.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization.

**Technology:** Google Colab, Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Tableau.

**Results:** Using Python functions the analysis dataset and visualization with Tableau and make the dashboard.

### Sales Insight and Pricing Impact Simulation with ML Algorithms
In this section I will doing data analytics projects sales product to produce insight about revenue, profit .

ðŸ’» **code:** [Analyzing sales and profit store.ipynb](https://github.com/Adamrakhmadi/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Sales_Adam_Updated.ipynb)

**Goal:** To analyze product sales data and simulate pricing strategies using machine learning models to support profit optimization..

**Description:** This project focuses on analyzing sales transaction data from the year 2013. The dataset includes various features such as transaction date, customer demographics (age, gender, location), product category, unit cost, unit price, and more. The workflow involves data loading, cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), correlation analysis, and the implementation of regression models to predict and simulate profit outcomes.

**Skills:** Data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, statistical testing, machine learning, and data visualization.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy.

**Results:** Built and compared two models: Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor to predict profit based on multiple features such as price, cost, and quantity.

-Conducted pricing simulations by modifying the unit price and analyzing the impact on profit.

-Found that strategic pricing adjustmentsâ€”based on model predictionâ€”can significantly increase profit margins.

-Created visualization plots to compare actual vs. predicted profits, helping support business decision-making.
